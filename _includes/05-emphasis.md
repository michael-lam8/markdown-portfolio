Some of my (supposedly) awesome attributes include: *working with the Senators for two years and continuing (despite not knowing anything about hockey)*, *the programming language **Processing***, and *my ability of not knowing how to use a dishwasher at my friends' because I don't have one and apparently everything I touch has to be washed by hand so what's the point*...
